    /// <summary>
    /// A neural network class that represents a network with recurrent (cyclic) connections. 
    /// 
    /// This is a much faster implementation of CyclicNetwork. The speedup is approximately 5x depending on 
    /// hardware and CLR platform, see http://sharpneat.sourceforge.net/network_optimization.html for detailed info.
    /// 
    /// The speedup is achieved by compactly storing all required data in arrays and in a way that maximizes
    /// in-order memory accesses; This allows us to maximize use of CPU caches. In contrast the CyclicNetwork
    /// class represents the network directly, that is, as a network of neuron/node objects; This has additional
    /// overhead such as the standard data associated with each object in dotNet which results in less efficient
    /// packing of the true neural net data in memory, which in turns results in less efficient use of CPU memory 
    /// caches. Finally, representing the network directly as a graph of connected nodes is not conducive to 
    /// writing code with in-order memory accesses.
    /// 
    /// Algorithm Overview.
    /// 1) Loop connections. Each connection gets its input signal from its source neuron, applies its weight and
    /// stores its output value./ Connections are ordered by source neuron index, thus all memory accesses here are
    /// sequential/in-order.
    /// 
    /// 2) Loop connections (again). Each connection adds its output value to its target neuron, thus each neuron  
    /// accumulates or 'collects' its input signal in its pre-activation variable. Because connections are sorted by
    /// source neuron index and not target index, this loop generates out-of order memory accesses, but is the only 
    /// loop to do so.
    /// 
    /// 3) Loop neurons. Pass each neuron's pre-activation signal through the activation function and set its 
    /// post-activation signal value. 
    /// 
    /// The activation loop is now complete and we can go back to (1) or stop.
