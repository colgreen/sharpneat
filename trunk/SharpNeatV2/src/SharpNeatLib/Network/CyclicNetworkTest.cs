    /// An algorithm for testing for the presence of at least one connectivity cycle within a network.
    /// 
    /// Method.
    /// =======
    /// 1) We loop over all nodes in the network and perform a depth-first traversal from each node. 
    /// (Note. the order that the nodes are traversed does not affext the correctness of the method)
    /// 
    /// 2) Each traversal keeps track of its ancestor nodes (the path to the current node) for each step
    /// in the traversal. Thus if the traversal encounters an ancestor node then a cycle has been detected.
    /// 
    /// 3) A set of visited nodes is maintained. This persists between traversals and allows each traversal 
    /// to avoid traversing into nodes that have already been traversed.
    /// 
    /// Note. We must traverse from each node rather then just e.g. the input nodes, because the network may 
    /// have connectivity dead ends or even isolated connectivity that therefore would not be traversed into 
    /// by following connectivity from the input nodes only, hence we perform a traversal from each node and
    /// attempt to maintain algorithmic efficiency by avoiding traversal into ndoes that haev already been 
    /// traversed into.
