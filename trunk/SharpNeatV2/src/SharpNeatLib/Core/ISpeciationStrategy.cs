    /// based on genome similarity, that is, we want similar genomes to be in the same specie so that they form a 
    /// gene pool that is more likely to produce fit offspring. This type of speciation is very much like the concept
    /// of clustering as used in the fields of computer science and data mining. This interface allows us to abstract
    /// the implementation of the speciation/clustering algorithm away from the main NEAT algorithm.

    /// instance of the Specie class contains a list of all genomes within that specie.
