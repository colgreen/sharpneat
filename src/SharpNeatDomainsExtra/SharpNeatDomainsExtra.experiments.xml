      <Description>
        Single Pole Balancing in 2D, with physics simulation in Box2D. This domain is also known as the inverted pendulum.

        The problem consists of a cart on a rail with fixed length. The cart moves along the x-axis (x=0 represents the center of the rail).
        A single pole is attached to the cart with a hinge that allows the pole to move left and right.

        An external agent can push the cart with a fixed force of 100 Newtons either left or right.

        The task is for the controller to balance the pole for as long as possible by applying force to the cart.
        * Timesteps are in increments of 1/60th of a second.
        * Maximum timesteps for a trial is 21,600 (6 minutes clock time).

        The controller is considered to have failed if the cart runs off the ends of the track and/or abs(pole angle) is >= 12 degress within the trial time.

        The model state variables are:
        * Cart position on rail (x-axis).
        * Cart velocity.
        * Pole angle.
        * Pole angular velocity.

        All four variables are provided to the controller; the velocity inputs in particular make the task an easy one to solve with no hidden nodes required.

        Inverted Double Pendulum in 2D, with physics simulation in Box2D.

        The problem consists of a cart on a rail with fixed length. The cart moves along the x-axis (x=0 represents the center of the rail).
        A pole is attached to the cart with a hinge that allows the pole to move left and right. The pole has a further hinged joint halfway
        along its length.

        An external agent can push the cart with a fixed force of 100 Newtons either left or right.

        The task is for the controller to balance the pole for as long as possible by applying force to the cart.
        * Timesteps are in increments of 1/60th of a second.
        * Maximum timesteps for a trial is 21,600 (6 minutes clock time).

        The controller is considered to have failed if the cart runs off the ends of the track and/or the height of the pole top falls below some threshold.

        The model state variables are:
        * Cart position on rail (x-axis).
        * Cart velocity.
        * Cart-Pole joint angle.
        * Cart-Pole joint angular velocity.
        * Pole elbow joint angle.
        * Pole elbow joint angular velocity.
