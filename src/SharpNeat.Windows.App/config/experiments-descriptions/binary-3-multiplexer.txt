Binary 3-Multiplexer Task.

A neural net has 3 inputs, one is a single address input, and two are data inputs. All of the inputs accept a binary value (zero or one).

There is a single output.

A binary address is presented to the address input, and this indicates which of the two data input values are to be selected for the output.

Evaluation consists of exhaustively evaluating the network against each of the 8 (2^3) possible input combinations. For each evaluation, the output value must match the value being presented to the data input selected by the address inputs.

An output less than 0.5 is considered a binary 0 response, and >=0.5 a binary 1. However, fitness at each evaluation is on a continuous linear scale, and these are summed across all evaluations to give a maximum possible fitness of 8.

An additional fitness of 100 is added to the total if all 8 test cases are passed, giving a maximum possible fitness of 108.
