/// Evaluator for the cart and double pole balancing task.

/// <remarks>
/// This task is solvable by SharpNEAT, but not on every run. This is likely due to 'deceptive' local maxima in the fitness landscape.
/// As such this task would be a reasonable choice for research into addressing the problem of fitness landscape deception.
///
/// This task can be made more difficult by not providing the velocity information (the cart and the two pole angular velocities)
/// to the neural network. Difficulty can be further increases by making the two pole lengths increasingly similar, with the task
/// becoming impossible when the poles have the same length.
///
/// As things stand the problem is difficult enough in its current form, therefore we provide velocity inputs and define two very
/// different pole lengths.
