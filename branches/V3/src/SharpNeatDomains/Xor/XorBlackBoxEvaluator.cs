    /// A black box evaluator for the XOR logic gate problem domain. 
    /// 
    /// XOR (also known as Exclusive OR) is a type of logical disjunction on two operands that results in
    /// a value of true if and only if exactly one of the operands has a value of 'true'. A simple way 
    /// to state this is 'one or the other but not both.'.
    /// 
    /// This evaulator therefore requires that the black box to be evaluated has has two inputs and one 
    /// output all using the range 0..1
    /// 
    /// In turn each of the four possible test cases are applied to the two inputs, the network is activated
    /// and the output is evaulated. If a 'false' response is requried we expect an output of zero, for true
    /// we expect a 1.0. Fitness for each test case is the difference between the output and the wrong output, 
    /// thus a maximum of 1 can be scored on each test case giving a maximum of 4. In addition each outputs is
    /// compared against a threshold of 0.5, if all four outputs are on teh correct side of the threshold then
    /// 10.0 is added to the total fitness. Therefore a black box that answers correctly but very close to the
    /// threshold will score just above 10, and a black box that answers correctly with perfect 0.0 and 1.0 
    /// answers will score a maximum of 14.0.
    /// 
    /// The first type of evaulation punishes for difference from the required outputs and therefore represents
    /// a smooth fitness space (we can evolve gradually towards better scores). The +10 score for 4 correct
    /// responses is 'all or nothing', in other words it is a fitness space with a large step and no indication
    /// of where the step is, which on it's own would be a poor fitness space as it required evolution to stumble
    /// on the correct network by random rather than ascending a gradient in the fitness space. If however we do 
    /// stumble on a black box that answers correctly but close to the threshold, then we would like that box to 
    /// obtain a higher score than a network with, say, 3 strong correct responses and but wrong overall. We can
    /// improve the correct box's output difference from threshold value gradually, while the box with 3 correct
    /// responses may actually be in the wrong area of the fitness space alltogether - in the wrong 'ballpark'.
