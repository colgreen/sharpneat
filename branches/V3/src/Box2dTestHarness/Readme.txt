Box2dTestHarness
================

A GUI test harness for Box2D worlds. This allows Box2D worlds to be simulated and rendered to screen using OpenGL.
External interaction with worlds is also possible via mouse events (drag objects around world with mouse clicks).

The intention i to use this harness to prototype and test Box2d worlds that can subsequently form the basis
of SharpNeat problem domain evaluators.
